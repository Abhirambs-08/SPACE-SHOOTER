# SPACE-SHOOTER
Shooter video games, also known as shooters, are a type of action video gamein which the focus is almost entirely on defeating the character's enemies with the weapons provided by the player. These weapons are typically firearms or other long- range weapons. Shooter games put the player's spatial awareness, reflexes, and speed to the test in both single-player and networked multiplayer settings. Shooter games are divided into several subgenres that share the focus on the actions of the avatar engaging in combat with a weapon against both code- driven NPC enemies and other avatars controlled by other players.

Shoot 'em ups (also known as shmups) are a type of shooter in which the player can move up, down, left, or right on the screen while firing straight ahead. Shoot 'em ups have similar gameplay but are frequently classified by viewpoint. This includes fixed-screen shooters like Space Invaders and Galaga.

The game developed in this project is a fixed-screen shooter called Space Shooter. Thepremise in Space Shooter is really simple: Your space piloting skills are the only thingstanding between the Earth and a dangerous alien invasion, which you must stop only with the help of your loyal spaceship.

## objectives
The main objective of this project is to entirely design and develop a 2D video game in shoot ’em up genre, entitled Space Shooter, while at the same time learning different disciplines and tools needed for game development. In order to be able to achieve this main objective, the project has been divided into multiple targets. The general targets include:

•	Creating a player-controlled character and giving it the ability to shoot bullets inside the game level.

•	Making one playable level with enemies and place them in randomized locations.

•	Creating visual effects such as explosions.

•	Making the level have parallax scroll like effect for movement.

•	While developing the game, try to learn as much as possible.
